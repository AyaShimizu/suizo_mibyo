15 is considered a cautious level, and people should decrease the amount of their alcohol intake.  
21 is regarded as a dangerous level, and people should consider going to the psychologist's office. Unfortunately, for people whose score is more than 20 should bring their alcohol intake to zero at one point, even if they have a healthy pancreas now. (It seems that for many people, it is difficult to quit completely as one drink usually leads to more. They need to go cold turkey. )
