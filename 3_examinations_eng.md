# Examinations

 From my experience, 80% of the test results (for patients with pancreas symptoms that can be cured through life treatments) come back negative. I will look into this further in the future.  
 However, it is important to note that some people do show abnormalities with their blood test or have pancreas cyst with an ultrasound test or have deformation of pancreas duct. Pancreas tumor is rare. If you doubt pancreatic symptom, you will need to do some examinations.  
　  
 On the other hand, many people come to our clinic with extreme anxiety about pancreatic cancer and potential death.  
 It's not surprising that one feels a certain level of anxiety from active symptoms but with no visible test abnormalities. Unfortunately many are recommended to go to a psychologist's office but feel no effect after psychiatric medications. Needless to say, in many cases, stress and anxiety is a burden to the pancreas.   
　  
 We recommend you to take the necessary tests properly and to do a proper follow-up to ensure your sense of security. The examinations for the pancreas is as follows.  

## 1. Blood Test

 The blood test is a convenient and necessary way to check the state of the pancreas. In many cases, the blood test is the fastest method to detect pancreas disease.  

### Amylase

 The most popular test item in the blood test is amylase (often abbreviated as AMY), but amylase can have a margin of inaccuracy. For instance, amylase has 91.7-100% sensitivity to acute pancreatitis in spite of severe symptoms. So, there is a chance that acute pancreatitis might be overlooked. In our patients, many people who have high lipase or trypsin ( which I will be explaining later) have no abnormality with amylase.  
　  
 Even if your amylase level is high, there are some patterns where you will not need to worry.  

#### Macroamylasemia

 Macroamylasemia is the most well-known condition where high-level amylase does not mean illness.  
There are quite a few people with macroamylase.  
Macroamylase is a substance that amylase attaches to immune globulin (a protein that works as an antibody).  
Because of it's size,  the kidneys can only filter macroamylase to urine at a slow pace.  
The difficulty of excretion of amylase to urine causes the high-level of amylase in the blood.  So it is not an illness. There is no need to worry about it.  

#### P-amylase (pancreatic amylase) is normal

 There are two types of amylase; Pancreatic amylase and salivary amylase.  
The number of pancreatic amylase goes up with pancreatic disease, and salivary amylase goes up with salivary sickness.  
Even if your amylase figures are high but so as long as the pancreatic amylase numbers are low, there is no problem with your pancreas.  

### Lipase

 Lipase is the most common examination of blood with pancreatic disease, after amylase.  
Different from amylase, the value of lipase rise almost exclusively with pancreatic disease and is highly credible.  
The cost of lipase check is reasonable, so asking your doctor to check up may not be so hard.  
Hepatic cirrhosis, duodenum ulcer perforation, kidney failure can also cause the high-level in lipase. However, these diseases are not so common compared to pancreas disease.  
 Some people who have low lipase than average level may feel anxious and overthink they have advanced chronic pancreatitis.  
However, if the imaging tests (e.g., ultrasound test) indicate none- abnormality, low-level lipase means no problem.  

### Trypsin

 Trypsin is also a highly credible examination, but the cost of trypsin is higher than lipase.  
So, we undergo this examination only for patients who need a precise check.
