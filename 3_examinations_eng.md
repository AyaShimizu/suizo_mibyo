# Examinations

 From my experience, 80% of the test results (for patients with pancreas symptoms that can be cured through life treatments) come back negative. I will look into this further in the future.  
 However, it is important to note that some people do show abnormalities with their blood test or have pancreas cyst with an ultrasound test or have deformation of pancreas duct. Pancreas tumor is rare. If you doubt pancreatic symptom, you will need to do some examinations.  
　  
 On the other hand, many people come to our clinic with extreme anxiety about pancreatic cancer and potential death.  
 It's not surprising that one feels a certain level of anxiety from active symptoms but with no visible test abnormalities. Unfortunately many are recommended to go to a psychologist's office but feel no effect after psychiatric medications. Needless to say, in many cases, stress and anxiety is a burden to the pancreas.   
　  
 We recommend you to take the necessary tests properly and to do a proper follow-up to ensure your sense of security. The examinations for the pancreas is as follows.  

## 1. Blood Test

 The blood test is a convenient and necessary way to check the state of the pancreas. In many cases, the blood test is the fastest method to detect pancreas disease.  

### Amylase

 The most popular test item in the blood test is amylase (often abbreviated as AMY), but amylase can have a margin of inaccuracy. For instance, amylase has 91.7-100% sensitivity to acute pancreatitis in spite of severe symptoms. So, there is a chance that acute pancreatitis might be overlooked. In our patients, many people who have high lipase or trypsin ( which I will be explaining later) have no abnormality with amylase.  
　  
 Even if your amylase level is high, there are some patterns where you will not need to worry.  

#### Macroamylasemia

 Macroamylasemia is the most well-known condition where high-level amylase does not mean illness.  
There are quite a few people with macroamylase.  
Macroamylase is a substance that amylase attaches to immune globulin (a protein that works as an antibody).  
Because of it's size,  the kidneys can only filter macroamylase to urine at a slow pace.  
The difficulty of excretion of amylase to urine causes the high-level of amylase in the blood.  So it is not an illness. There is no need to worry about it.  

#### P-amylase (pancreatic amylase) is normal

 There are two types of amylase; Pancreatic amylase and salivary amylase.  
The number of pancreatic amylase goes up with pancreatic disease, and salivary amylase goes up with salivary sickness.  
Even if your amylase figures are high but so as long as the pancreatic amylase numbers are low, there is no problem with your pancreas.  

### Lipase

 Lipase is the most common examination of blood with pancreatic disease, after amylase.  
Different from amylase, the value of lipase rise almost exclusively with pancreatic disease and is highly credible.  
The cost of lipase check is reasonable, so asking your doctor to check up may not be so hard.  
Hepatic cirrhosis, duodenum ulcer perforation, kidney failure can also cause the high-level in lipase. However, these diseases are not so common compared to pancreas disease.  
 Some people who have low lipase than average level may feel anxious and overthink they have advanced chronic pancreatitis.  
However, if the imaging tests (e.g., ultrasound test) indicate none- abnormality, low-level lipase means no problem.  

### Trypsin

Trypsin is also a highly credible examination, but the cost of trypsin is higher than lipase.  
So, we undergo this examination only for patients who need a precise check.  

### Elastase 1

Elastase 1 rises with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. We undergo this examination only for patients who have high-level lipase or trypsin.

### CA19-9

CA19-9 is popular tumor marker.  Unfortunately,  this examination is unreliable and can lead to unnecessary worries.  
We only undergo this examination for patients who have high-level lipase or trypsin.

## Abdominal Ultrasound

Abdominal ultrasound is essential due to its convenience and safety. Its weakness is in the visualization of organs when there are too much fat or intestine gas. Abdominal ultrasound is very cost-effective because it can check out not only pancreas but gallbladder, liver, spleen, and kidneys.  
Pancreatic cancers measuring less than 1 cm are detected by ultrasound in only 50% of cases, while the sensitivity increases to 95.8% for tumors larger than 3 cm. (*1)

## MRCP

MRCP(Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) is a technique of MRI for checking up pancreas, gallbladder, bile duct. Especially, it is very useful for viewing abnormality of the pancreatic duct and deformation of the pancreas. In recent years, the imaging quality and diagnostic performance improved significantly. It is reported that sensitivity is 95% and specificity is 82% for diagnosing pancreatic cancer.*  
Compared to CAT scan, MRI does not cause radiation exposure, but it makes loud noise and patients will be rolled into a narrow tunnel for about 30 minutes, so people who have claustrophobia may feel arduous.

## Contrast-enhanced CT scan

A contrast-enhanced CT scan may better than MRCP when it used for detecting small tumors. Its sensitivity is 85 - 100%, and specificity is 82 - 92%. A plain CT cannot detect pancreatic cancer in many cases so that Japan Pancreas Society do not recommend plain CT for detecting pancreatic cancers.  
Demerits of contrast-enhanced CT scan is radiation exposure and risk of side effect of contrast agent. The incidence rate of contrast agent side effects is about 3%. Serious side effect (e.x. shock, cardiac arrest, dyspnea) incidence rate is 0.04 - 0.004%.
