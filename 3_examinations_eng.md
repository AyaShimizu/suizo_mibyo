# Examinations

 From my experience, 80% of the test results (for patients with pancreas symptoms that can be cured through life treatments) come back negative. I will look into this further in the future.  
 However, it is important to note that some people do show abnormalities with their blood test or have pancreas cyst with an ultrasound test or have deformation of pancreas duct. Pancreas tumor is rare. If you doubt pancreatic symptom, you will need to do some examinations.  
　  
 On the other hand, many people come to our clinic with extreme anxiety about pancreatic cancer and potential death.  
 It's not surprising that one feels a certain level of anxiety from active symptoms but with no visible test abnormalities. Unfortunately many are recommended to go to a psychologist's office but feel no effect after psychiatric medications. Needless to say, in many cases, stress and anxiety is a burden to the pancreas.   
　  
 We recommend you to take the necessary tests properly and to do a proper follow-up to ensure your sense of security. The examinations for the pancreas is as follows.  

## 1. Blood Test

 The blood test is a convenient and necessary way to check the state of the pancreas. In many cases, the blood test is the fastest method to detect pancreas disease.  

### Amylase

 The most popular test item in the blood test is amylase (often abbreviated as AMY), but amylase can have a margin of inaccuracy. For instance, amylase has 91.7-100% sensitivity to acute pancreatitis in spite of severe symptoms. So, there is a chance that acute pancreatitis might be overlooked. In our patients, many people who have high lipase or trypsin ( which I will be explaining later) have no abnormality with amylase.
