# Life Therapy

## Life Therapy

 The most important treatment for the weak pancreas is life therapy.  
Many people will get better through life therapy, and medication treatment without life therapy may not have any effects.  
So, if you have a weak pancreas, please address life therapy.  
However, don't be too serious.  
Especially, if you think that "insufficient life therapy may lead to death," it's wrong.  

## Alcohol

 Alcohol is the most harmful substance for the pancreas.  
Almost all causes of death by the pancreas are cancer or alcohol.  
So stop taking alcohol is most crucial life therapy, if you have a weak pancreas.  
Sweets using alcohol also must be avoided.  
If you use alcohol for cooking, please heat it thoroughly.  
If you feel difficulty with alcohol, we will explore this topic later.   

## Lipid-restricted diet

 Fat has significantly less ill effect compared to alcohol, but it is a leading cause of pancreatic pain.  
We recommend taking 25 to 50g fat every day.  
You can even take fried food if your intake of fat is in that range. Of course, it must be a small amount.  
When you use dressing for a salad, we recommend none oil type.  
Dining out often leads to taking an excessive amount of fat, so maybe restrict eating out frequently.  
　  
Remember, even if you eat pasta, it also uses a significant amount of oil.  
Also, in most cases, one-third of ingredients in sweets is butter, so you must be mindful of the amount you eat.  

## No Special Oil

 Patients sometimes ask me if they can take more than 50g of fish oil or perilla oil or extra-virgin olive oil, but any oil can cause the pancreatic pain.  
In theory, medium-chain triglycerides(MCT) oil have less burden for the pancreas, but patients who come to our clinic have told us that despite the cost, the oil has brought no changes in their pain.   
We recommend you to restrict the amount of fat.  Do not have high hopes using expensive oils or challenge yourself with other materials.  

## Allergy-like response

 Some people may have reactions to a specific oil.
